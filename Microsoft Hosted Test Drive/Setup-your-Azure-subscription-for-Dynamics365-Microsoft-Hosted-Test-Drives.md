      *    Take note of your 'Application ID' displayed in the properties section. You will need this value later when configuring your Test Drive.
      *    Generate a secret for the Azure AD App. Navigate to 'Keys' in the settings menu. In the 'Passwords' section, enter a Key Description (Example "Test Drive") and set the duration to two years or as appropriate. Be aware that your Test Drive will break once this Key expires and you will need to generate and provide to AppSource a new key when this happens.
